# MESSAGES.YML
# ------------
# This file is composed of every possible message in MoreLuckyBlocks.
# The individual messages in the plugin are NOT labeled, do NOT edit the numbers with the colons
# next to the messages.
# Instead, search for the message you want to edit (ctrl+f on many editors) and then edit that text.
# Notepad++ is the reccomended editor.
# If you ever mess up your messages.yml file, you can download a fresh copy at:
# https://github.com/devjluvisi/MoreLuckyBlocks/blob/main/src/main/resources/messages.yml
